### PostScript Fonts

PostScript fonts come in two flavors: Early, and Level 3.

In PostScript Level 3, you have more flexibility and control over font rendering than in previous versions, largely due to improved handling of fonts including Type 1 smooth shading and enhanced memory management, which is crucial for handling complex font designs.

### Creating a Simple PostScript Level 3 Font

To illustrate how to define a sample font in PostScript, we can create a simple custom font based on vector paths for each character. Let's create a basic font with just a few characters (A, B, and C) to demonstrate the process.

#### Step 1: Define the Font Dictionary

First, we define a font dictionary that specifies the font's properties and the character procedures. Each character will be drawn using its own procedure that defines its shape.

```postscript
%!
/MySimpleFont 25 dict def  % Create a dictionary for the font
MySimpleFont begin
  /FontType 3 def  % Type 3 font
  /FontMatrix [1 0 0 1 0 0] def  % Transformation matrix for the font
  /FontBBox [0 0 100 100] def  % Bounding box in which all glyphs fit
  /Encoding 256 array def  % Define the encoding array

  % Define character mappings
  Encoding 65 /A put
  Encoding 66 /B put
  Encoding 67 /C put

  % Define each character's drawing procedure
  /CharProcs 3 dict def
  CharProcs begin
    /A {newpath 10 0 moveto 50 100 lineto 90 0 lineto closepath} def
    /B {newpath 10 0 moveto 10 100 lineto 50 100 50 50 50 0 curveto closepath} def
    /C {newpath 100 75 moveto 50 100 25 75 25 25 curveto 25 25 50 0 100 25 curveto closepath} def
  end

  % Define how each character is built
  /BuildGlyph {
    exch begin
    CharProcs exch get exec
    end
  } def

  % Define how to show each character
  /BuildChar {
    1 0 0 1 0 0 setfontmatrix
    BuildGlyph
  } def
end
```

#### Step 2: Create a Test Page to Use the Font

Once the font is defined, we can use it within a document to display text. The following script sets up a page and writes "ABC" using `MySimpleFont`.

```postscript
/MySimpleFont findfont 25 scalefont setfont  % Select the font and scale it
50 50 moveto  % Move to starting position on the page
(A) show
70 50 moveto  % Adjust position for next character
(B) show
90 50 moveto  % Adjust position for next character
(C) show
showpage  % Render the page
```

This code snippet sets up a very basic custom font where each character is a simple geometric shape. More complex glyphs would require more detailed path definitions and possibly hinting instructions for proper rendering at smaller sizes. By experimenting with the `CharProcs`, you can define any vector shape to represent your characters. This flexibility makes Type 3 fonts powerful tools for custom graphics and specialized typesetting tasks in PostScript.


For non-Level 3 fonts in PostScript, one of the most common types used is the Type 1 font. Type 1 fonts are outline fonts that are not as flexible as Type 3 fonts in terms of custom operations, but they are widely used because of their efficiency and support across various platforms and printers.

### Creating a Simple Type 1 Font Example

Below, I will demonstrate how to set up a simple Type 1 font using standard font definitions available within PostScript interpreters. Unlike Type 3 fonts, where you can define the shape of each character directly in PostScript, Type 1 fonts typically come pre-defined and are simply invoked and used.

#### Step 1: Select and Set Up the Font

You typically select a Type 1 font by its name from the fonts available in the PostScript environment. Letâ€™s use the well-known "Helvetica" for demonstration. This example will show how to use the font to print text on a page.

```postscript
%!
/Helvetica findfont  % Find the Helvetica font
24 scalefont  % Scale the font to 24 points
setfont  % Set the current font to the scaled font

100 700 moveto  % Move to position on the page (x=100, y=700)
(Hello, this is Helvetica!) show  % Display the text

showpage  % Render the page
```

#### Explanation

1. **Font Selection**: The `/Helvetica findfont` command searches for "Helvetica" in the font dictionary available to the PostScript interpreter.
2. **Scaling**: The `24 scalefont` command adjusts the font size to 24 points. This transformation scales the font metrics accordingly.
3. **Setting the Font**: `setfont` applies the scaled font as the current font.
4. **Positioning and Showing Text**: The `moveto` command sets the starting point for the text, and `show` outputs the string "Hello, this is Helvetica!" at the specified location.
5. **Rendering**: The `showpage` command flushes the page to the output device, rendering the text.

### Notes on Usage

- **Type 1 fonts** are primarily used for text rather than for creating custom graphics or symbols (which is more flexible with Type 3 fonts).
- These fonts are standardized and optimized for performance across different output devices, making them a preferred choice for text in professional printing and desktop publishing.
- Modifying or creating custom Type 1 fonts generally requires specialized font editing software and a deep understanding of the font hinting, which goes beyond typical PostScript programming.

Using Type 1 fonts involves significantly less direct manipulation of font properties within PostScript code compared to Type 3 fonts. The focus with Type 1 fonts in PostScript is more on text layout, font selection, and simple transformations like scaling and rotating rather than on defining glyph shapes directly.
