   file resetfile  % Moves the file pointer back to the start of the file
   ```

18. **resourceforall**: Executes a procedure for each resource in a category.

   ```
   reversepath  % Reverses the current drawing path
   ```

22. **revision**: Returns the revision number of the PostScript interpreter.
   ```
   revision  % Might return "3010" or other version number
   ```

23. **rlineto**: Adds a relative line to the current path from the current point.
   ```
   newpath 0 0 moveto 100 100 rlineto  % Draws a line from (0,0) to (100,100) relative to the last point
   ```

24. **rmoveto**: Moves the current point relative to the last point.
   ```
   100 100 rmoveto  % Moves the current point 100 units right and 100 units up from the last point
   ```

25. **roll**: Rolls the specified number of items on the stack.
