### Operators: *E*

1. **echo**: The `echo` operator prints out the provided arguments to the output device. Example:
   ```
   (Hello, world!) echo    % Prints "Hello, world!" to the output device
   ```

2. **eexec**: The `eexec` operator decrypts a string that was encoded using the "eexec" encoding algorithm. Example:
   ```
   (encrypted_string) eexec    % Decrypts the encrypted string
   ```

3. **end**: The `end` operator marks the end of a code block in PostScript. It's often paired with `begin` to enclose a section of code.

4. **eoclip**: The `eoclip` operator intersects the current path with the even-odd fill rule and sets the resulting path as the clipping path.

5. **eofill**: The `eofill` operator fills the current path using the even-odd fill rule.

6. **eoviewclip**: The `eoviewclip` operator intersects the current path with the even-odd fill rule and sets the resulting path as the clipping path for viewing.

7. **eq**: The `eq` operator compares two operands for equality. It returns true if the operands are equal, false otherwise. Example:
   ```
   10 10 eq    % Result: true (because 10 is equal to 10)
   ```

8. **erasepage**: The `erasepage` operator clears the current page, effectively erasing all content on it.

9. **errordict**: The `errordict` operator retrieves the error dictionary, which contains information about error handling in PostScript.

10. **exch**: The `exch` operator exchanges the positions of the top two elements on the operand stack. Example:
    ```
    1 2 exch    % Stack becomes [2 1]
    ```

11. **exec**: The `exec` operator executes a procedure. It takes a procedure from the operand stack and executes it.

12. **execform**: The `execform` operator executes a form (a named dictionary) as if it were a procedure.

13. **execstack**: The `execstack` operator retrieves all procedures currently on the execution stack.

14. **execstackoverflow**: The `execstackoverflow` operator checks if the execution stack has overflowed. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the stack has overflowed.

15. **execuserobject**: The `execuserobject` operator executes a user object (a procedure or an executable name).

16. **executeonly**: The `executeonly` operator marks a procedure as execute-only, preventing it from being inspected or executed again.

17. **executive**: The `executive` operator executes a procedure.

18. **exit**: The `exit` operator exits the current loop or procedure.

19. **exitserver**: The `exitserver` operator instructs the PostScript interpreter to exit the current server loop.

20. **exp**: The `exp` operator calculates the exponential function of a number. Example:
    ```
    2 exp    % Result: 7.389 (the exponential function of 2)
    ```
