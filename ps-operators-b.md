1. **begin**: The `begin` operator marks the start of a code block in PostScript. It is often paired with `end` to enclose a section of code. For example:
   ```
   /myDict << /Name (John) /Age 30 >> begin
       % Code block
   end
   ```

2. **bind**: The `bind` operator associates a name with a procedure. It's commonly used for creating higher-order functions or dynamically binding procedures to names. Example:
   ```
   /addTwo { 2 add } bind def
   3 addTwo   % Result: 5 (because 3 + 2 = 5)
   ```

3. **bitshift**: The `bitshift` operator performs a bitwise shift operation on an integer. It shifts the bits of the first integer operand left (if the second operand is positive) or right (if the second operand is negative) by the number of bits specified by the absolute value of the second operand. Example:
   ```
   8 2 bitshift   % Result: 32 (because 8 << 2 = 32)
   ```

4. **bytesavailable**: The `bytesavailable` operator returns the number of bytes available for reading from a file. It's typically used to check how much data is ready to be read from a file. Example:
   ```
   (myfile.txt) (r) file bytesavailable   % Result: Number of bytes available for reading from myfile.txt
   ```
